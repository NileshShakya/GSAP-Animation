# GSAP-Animation
GSAP is the most robust high-performance javascript animation library on the planet, which is probably why Google recommends it for JS-based animations and every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations. Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want.

It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, React, Vue, generic objects, whatever) and it solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery), including automatic GPU-acceleration of transforms.
